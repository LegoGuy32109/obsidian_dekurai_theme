## Some smart text
Just look at this beautiful link color. [[Link to some other note]]. Have you ever seen such a beautiful shade of green? [[Have you ever seen such a beautiful shade of green?]]. I donâ€™t know how well thought out this theme is, but I tried to make it good. By the way, the preview and the source are practically the same.

>Knowing the world is finding the best shade of green.

## Code example
```c#
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
