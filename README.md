"Dekurai" is a theme where I tried to combine clean nice colors, minimalism and functionality. Technically this [Dark Moss v2.0](https://github.com/sergey900553/obsidian_githublike_theme).
# Highlights
In addition to the fact that this theme is great, I would like to highlight certain points that made my user experience better.
## Editing and Reading mode remain consistent.
I still use the good old mode switching. And I don't like it if they are very different. Therefore, I tried to make them consistent so that there would be no confusion when switching.
